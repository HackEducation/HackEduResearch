<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2016/the-blockchain-in-education-links">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started a new research project on the blockchain and what it might offer for education. I&rsquo;m interested in gaining a better understanding of the technology, and I&rsquo;d like to be better positioned to weigh in on the discussions in which blockchain is increasingly posited as some revolutionary solution for credentials, assessment, and identity management.</p>
<p>Thanks to some suggestions from The Internet, here&rsquo;s a list of materials I&rsquo;m working my way through:</p>

<p>I'll continue to update this list as more suggestions come in. I'm specifically looking for two things: 1) an explanation of blockchain technology suitable for tech-savvy non-cryptographers and 2) an explanation of how this technology could be used/useful in education. (And specifically how the tech would work in a non-financial setting, too. No hand-waving away those questions or acting like "it's decentralized!" is sufficient.)</p>
<p>Mostly I'm curious about this: what education problem does blockchain actually solve?</p>
