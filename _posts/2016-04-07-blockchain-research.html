<p>I've published <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/04/07/blockchain-education-guide">Part One</a> of my research on the blockchain in education. It's already been <a href="http://www.aud.life/2016/link-jacking-in-ed-tech">link-jacked</a>, so that sucks.</p>

<p>I plan to write another piece in this series over the next few days, one that focuses more on the ideology behind the blockchain (and cryptocurrencies), and why those might give us pause if we think about how the blockchain might work in education.</p>
