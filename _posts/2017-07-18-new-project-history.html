<p>I&#8217;ve added a new item to my list of research projects: <a href="http://history.hackeducation.com">The History of Ed-Tech Companies</a>. </p>

<p>This project is part of the larger work I&#8217;m doing with my <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/03/31/spencer-fellow">Spencer Fellowship</a> to trace where ed-tech ideas originate and how they spread. It involves looking at the history of companies like <a href="http://history.hackeducation.com/pearson.html">Pearson</a> and The Princeton Review, as well as the history of organizations like the <a href="http://history.hackeducation.com/gates-foundation.html">Gates Foundation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">I&#8217;m using Timeline.js</a> to make a number of timelines to help visualize these histories, but trying to include links to as many articles and resources as I can so it&#8217;s not just a series of pretty images and accompanying events.</p>
