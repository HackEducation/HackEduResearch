<p>I&#8217;ve added a new item to my list of research projects: <a href="http://history.hackeducation.com">The History of Ed-Tech Companies</a>. </p>

<p>This project is part of the larger work I&#8217;m doing with my Spencer Fellowship to trace where ed-tech ideas originate and how they spread. It involves looking at the history of companies like Pearson and The Princeton Review, as well as the history of organizations like the Gates Foundation.</p>

<p><a href="https://timeline.knightlab.com/">I&#8217;m using Timeline.js</a> to make a number of timelines to help visualize these histories, but trying to include links to as many articles and resources as I can so it&#8217;s not just a series of pretty images and accompanying events.</p>
