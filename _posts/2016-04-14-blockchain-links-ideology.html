<p>I've published <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/04/14/blockchain-ideology">Part Two</a> of my research on the blockchain in education. I'm guessing Edsurge isn't going to link to this one, heh, as I call out the dangerous, anti-democratic ideology of "the Silicon Valley narrative," something that is so neatly packed into the blockchain (and in Edsurge too, for that matter).</p>

<p>While I'm at it, I've collected a couple more links to other blockchain-related stories:</p>

<p>The disruption. It burns.</p>
