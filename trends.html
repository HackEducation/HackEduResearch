<h3>Top Ed-Tech Trends <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/template_trend.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>

<p>At the end of every year since I founded Hack Education, I've reviewed what I think are the most important and influential trends in education technology. This isn't just list of ten products or a quick dash through popular technologies that marketers are the most active pushing. Rather, it's an in-depth exploration of the events of the year and an analysis of how these events in education and in technology shape the way in which we imagine the future of teaching and learning.</p>
